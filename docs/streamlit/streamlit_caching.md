# Streamlit Caching Examples

Streamlit runs your script from top to bottom at every user interaction or code change. This execution model makes development super easy. But it comes with two major challenges:

- Long-running functions run again and again, which slows down your app.
- Objects get recreated again and again, which makes it hard to persist them across reruns or sessions.

But don't worry! Streamlit lets you tackle both issues with its built-in caching mechanism. Caching stores the results of slow function calls, so they only need to run once. This makes your app much faster and helps with persisting objects across reruns.

Here are examples demonstrating how to use Streamlit's caching functionality to optimize performance by caching expensive computations and data loading operations:

## 1. Caching Function Results
```python
import streamlit as st

# Define a function with expensive computation
@st.cache
def expensive_computation(x):
    # Some expensive computation
    return x * x

# Call the function with different inputs
result1 = expensive_computation(5)
result2 = expensive_computation(5)  # This call will be cached
result3 = expensive_computation(10)

# Display results
st.write("Result 1:", result1)
st.write("Result 2:", result2)
st.write("Result 3:", result3)
```

In this example, the `expensive_computation()` function is decorated with `@st.cache`, which tells Streamlit to cache the results of the function based on its inputs. Subsequent calls to the function with the same inputs will return the cached result instead of recomputing it.

## 2. Caching Data Loading Operations
```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd

# Define a function to load data
@st.cache
def load_data(filename):
    # Some expensive data loading operation
    data = pd.read_csv(filename)
    return data

# Load data from file
filename = "data.csv"
data = load_data(filename)

# Display the loaded data
st.write(data)
```

In this example, the `load_data()` function is decorated with `@st.cache`, indicating that the result of the data loading operation should be cached. Subsequent calls to load the data from the same file will return the cached result instead of reloading the data from the file.

These examples demonstrate how to use Streamlit's caching functionality to optimize the performance of your app by caching expensive computations and data loading operations. You can use caching to speed up the execution of your app and improve the overall user experience.
