# Model Deployment Tutorial

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to deploy pretrained models using Streamlit, Django, and Flask. This tutorial is designed for first-year students and aims to provide a basic understanding of networking concepts such as requests, responses, JSON, APIs, and the Fetch API in Python.

**Objectives:**

- Understand fundamental networking concepts.
- Learn to build APIs and endpoints using Flask and Django.
- Create a website for model deployment using Streamlit.

> **Note:**
> This tutorial does not cover how to build machine learning models, as our focus is on deploying pretrained models.

### TODO: 

- [] Schedule a meeting to discuss the core of this tutorial and distribute tasks.
